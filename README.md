# Strategy Pack

[![Open in HACS at your Home Assistant instance.][hacsBadge]][strategyPackHacs]

This is a collection of [Home Assistant Strategies](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-strategy/).

A strategy is a piece of JavaScript code that runs when you open a page that is configured to use it to generate dashboards and views. They make it easy to create auto-populated dashboards with minimal configuration!

## Example

This is a Dashboard generated by the included area-dashboard-strategy:


![Example Dashboard](./documentation/assets/area/area-strategy.gif "Example Dashboard")

## Usage Example

Below is a minimal configuration showing how to use a JavaScript template to
generate cards for each entity. The template receives the entity id as `$entity`,
the current area name as `$area` and a `state_attr()` helper for reading entity
attributes.

```yaml
type: custom:area-dashboard-strategy
config:
  grids:
    - id: control_light
      title: Lights
      filter:
        include:
          - type: domain
            value: light
      card:
        template: |
          const name = state_attr($entity, 'friendly_name')
            .replace($area, '')
            .trim();
          if (state_attr($entity, 'supported_color_modes')?.includes('color_temp')) {
            return {
              entity: $entity,
              name,
              type: 'custom:mushroom-light-card',
              show_brightness_control: true,
              show_color_temp_control: true,
              collapsible_controls: true,
              use_light_color: true
            };
          }
```

## Credits

Thanks to everyone working on Home Assistant and the everyone in the community. Without your documentation, code, and forum posts, I wouldn't have even thought about this.

The design is heavily inspired by [Dwains Dashboard][dwainsDashboard], as that the first more advanced dashboard i used because the design and auto-population really hit a nerve with me. I wanna thank Dwain for his great work. His Dashboard is more User-friendly and works without any yaml-Knowledge so it is absolutely a better fit for many Users. Give it a try!

Also have a look at [Mushroom Strategy][mushroomStrategy], which has a very similar concept to the Area Strategy. I must admit i also shamelessly copied their installation instructions.
